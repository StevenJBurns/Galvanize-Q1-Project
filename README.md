# Galvanize-Q1-Project
---
My final project for first quarter as a Web Development Immersive student at Galvanize in Boulder, CO.
---
A front end application that executes two API calls to the NASA Exoplanet Database, normalizes the returned data and presents "usable" star and planet data in a visualization of extrasolar systems.
